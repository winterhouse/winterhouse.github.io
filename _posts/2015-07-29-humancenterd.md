### human-computer-interaction

#### Needfinding

what do people do&&values and goals&&how these activities embedded

#### interviewing

choosing participants(representation of target users,such as stakeholders , current user of a similar system, non-users).

what are good questions?

open ended<----->too large
interesting is important.

questions to avoid(1:what they would do\like\want in hypothetical situation;2:how often;3:how much do you like on an absolute scale;4:avoid binary quesitons)

<!-- more -->

#### survey

#### diary observation

give people a diary notebook or a structured task or camera,voice...

#### experience sampling

lead user(they will make their own solution before they get one)

extreme users(can be extreme in all directions)

### Rapid prototyping

####  storyboard:(focus on performing, what happening in key time)

A:setting(people involved, environment, task being accomplished)

B:sequence(step involved, what leads someone to use the app, what task is being illustrated)

C:satisfaction(motivation, what does it enable people to accomplish, what needs does the system fill)

#### wizard of oz(make an interactive application without code)

video prototyping
(cheap and fast)



### Heuristic Evaluation

![Alt text](http://obhvbhenx.bkt.clouddn.com//image/blog/coursera/humancenter/principle.jpg)

find problems and before user testing

find a set of people---->some heuristic principles----->look for problems
